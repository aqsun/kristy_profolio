          <p class="description">Train Pro is a fitness mobile application to provide an effective approach for trainees to find their perfect trainers,
            and in reverse for trainers to find the potential trainee. There are four members working on this application. I was mainly focused on one of
            the features (chatting system) in this application. In chatting system, trainer and trainee can set and keep track of appointment through chatting
            which is more convenient for them to communicate and choose the suitable time during the conversation. Another feature is the profile. As a trainee,
            by filling out some basic information on the profile are able to narrow down your search for right trainers and to show your specific needs in training.
            The map is another feature that allows a trainee to find trainers around trainee's preferred location of training.</p>

           <h3 class="description_title">Research</h3>
           <p class="description">I did some research and interview some personal trainer and trainee to get some background of training, The research and interview
             help me to understand the demand for both trainer and trainee, such as I realized that there are a few fitness applicants to help people finding
             an appropriate trainer. Moreover, most of the time, people would like to take shortcuts to catch up their desire and get quickly what they want in order to continue
             the fast-paced life. Our idea of Train Pro application is useful for potential trainees to start the first step. For trainers, they would like to see an interface that
             would help them to find more clients and show more information about their potential clients' needs before their first meets.</p>

              <h3 class="description_title">Brainstorming</h3>
              <p class="description">I used a diagram to lay out some key points of my ideas which is easier for groupmates to understand my idea. The diagram on the left shows the biggest
                problem for a trainee is they don't have much time to find their match trainer. To solve the problem, It is easily and conveniently for trainees to post their goal, basic
                information and their demands on the Find Your Personal Trainer website to allow all the trainers to view and approach the potential trainees and is easier for trainees to
                start their first step and save much time to look for their match trainer. So this is how we identify one of our features "profile" at the start of our apps.</p>
              <p class="description">
                The diagram on the right shows all our features on the apps. We thought out all potential functions together and used gray circles to classified those potential functions
                under each feature. Brainstorming brings our idea into Visualization for better presenting our concept.</p>

              <div class="row justify-content-around">
                  <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-8 col-10">

              </div>

          <h3 class="description_title">Sketches</h3>
          <p class="description">I sketched out the wireframe of our application process to provide a general idea of our interface. Our interface starts with two branches, trainee and trainer.
            If the user needs to choose either side depending who they are. After that, they need to fill out their profile to provide general information such as their purpose of training,
            their goal, and demand. Then the application will filter some perfect trainers for a trainee, and some potential trainees for trainer base on the information they filling on the profile.</p>

          <h3 class="description_title">Chatting Section</h3>
          <p class="description">Later on, I was responsible for Chatting Section since chatting is the crucial part to improve the communication between trainer and trainee in the TrainPro application.
            I need to design and consider more useful features for users to better maintain their connection through the chat system. I added a set and keep track appointment feature, which is more
            convenient for both trainer and trainee to confirm the training time and both trainer and trainee are able to see their appointment on their schedule. when the time is close to the appointment date.
            The notification will appear on the main screen to remind the user of the appointment.</p>

        <h3 class="description_title">Final Project</h3>
        <p class="description">The challenge of this project is there are four members a group, every member has his/her own
          ideas and reasons of the interface design and different features used in the application, so argument and disagreement
          is unavoidable during working process, which is the main issue that prevents us keep working with low efficiency at each
          meeting. Moreover, each member is working on one feature, so when we combine all features together, the overall design is not
          consistent, so we need to spend extra time to adjust each member's working which increases everyone's workload.</p>
